  <p class="lead">Good stuff! You've downloaded and set up Live Wires successfully on your machine. Here's how it works:</p>
  <p>Live Wires is a platform-agnostic design framework made with Sass that allows you to create responsive grey-box wireframes and prototypes in HTML &amp SCSS. You can keep all your code without needing to create static mock ups or other deliverables you end up throwing away.<p>
  <h2>Sugested Live Wires workflow<h2>
  <h3>Step one</h3>
  <p>Begin by creating your low-fidelity wireframes right here. This page will act as the index or home page of your project. Feel free to delete or overwrite the content on this page with your own.</p>
  <h3>Step two</h3>
  <p>Use the <a href="usage/guide">linked style guide</a> to style your elements, components, and modules.</p>
  <h3>Step three</h3>
  <p>Refine your templates and share with your team or clients as fully-responsive high-fidelity prototypes.</p>
  <h3>Step four</h3>
  <p>Apply your prototype to a CMS or app and your project is now complete.</p>
  
  <p><i>Today we stop making trash and, instead, start building living, breathing beauties that will look and act the way they were imagined.</i></p>
