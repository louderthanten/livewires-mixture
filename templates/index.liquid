    <h1>Live Wires Playground</h1>
    <p class="lead">Welcome to your very own Live Wires project. Live Wires is a framework made with Sass and Mixture that allows you to create responsive grey-box wireframes in HTML &amp SCSS. Create your wireframes right here. Then customize them, style them, and share them as living low-fidelity prototypes instead of static files you sweat over and later toss away.</p>
   <p>Today we stop making trash and, instead, start building living, breathing beauties that will look and act the way they were imagined.</p>
